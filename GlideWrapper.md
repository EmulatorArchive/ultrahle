In order to run the emulator, you will need to put the glide2x.dll in the emulator folder or your sytem path. I recommend using . My top recommendations would be:
  * [nGlide](http://www.zeus-software.com/downloads/nglide)
  * [Zeckensack version 0.84c](http://www.zeckensack.de/glide/)
  * [nGlide xgl200](http://www.glideunderground.com/articles/WrappersApr05/xgl200_0.04a.zip)

nGlide seems to be the most up to date on the list.
