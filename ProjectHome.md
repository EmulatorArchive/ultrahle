## UltraHLE Source Code 1.0.0 ##

By: Epsilon and RealityMan


  * This will not compile out of the box. You need Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.
  * Source code (or docs) for the Glide library, X-Engine, is not included.
  * Someone has already ported this to use OpenGL. Perhaps they will release it soon.
  * Look at ultra.h for various info


I have not affiliation with Epsilon or RealityMan. I just posted this  for posterity sake.
